This repository contains different variants of the Blackbox framework 1.7.2 used to test my [Oberon+](https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/documentation/The_Programming_Language_Oberon%2B.adoc) parser and validator.

I downloaded Blackbox from the original sites and run *odcread* (see [this post](https://community.blackboxframework.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=272&p=1760&hilit=odcread#p1760)) on each Mod/*.odc file to create the corresponding source code text file.

Then I removed some subsystems and transpiled the source code to Oberon+ using my [OberonViewer 0.8.4](https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon#code-browser-features). The resulting code needed still some manual modifications.

See in the sub-folders for more information.

Here is a screenshot of the current state of the Oberon+ IDE with the Windows Blackbox framework loaded:

The ~96 kLOC (physical code lines, no whitespace or comment only lines) require less than two seconds to parse and validate on my HP EliteBook 2530p. See https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon for more information.
