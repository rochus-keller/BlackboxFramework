This repository contains a modified subset of the Windows version of the Blackbox framework 1.7.2 used to test the [Oberon+](https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/documentation/The_Programming_Language_Oberon%2B.adoc) parser and validator. 

It includes the minimal set of modules required to statically resolve all dependencies, plus some selected modules which are accessed by text commands (i.e. late binding). The code is not yet expected to be executable, but to test the parser and demonstrate the semantic navigation features of the IDE.
