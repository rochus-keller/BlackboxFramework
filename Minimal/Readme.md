This repository contains a modified subset of the Windows version of the Blackbox framework 1.7.2 used to test the [Oberon+](https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/blob/master/documentation/The_Programming_Language_Oberon%2B.adoc) parser and validator. It only includes the minimal set of modules required to statically resolve all dependencies. The code is not yet expected to be executable, but to test and demonstrate the semantic navigation features of the IDE.
